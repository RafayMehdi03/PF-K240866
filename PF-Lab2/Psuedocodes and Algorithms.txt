ALGORITHMS

Q1) 
.Take as input the number who's divisors needs to be calculated
.Set a variable named divisor to 1
.Check if Number MOD divisor is 0
.If true then print this divisor
.If false then do not print and move on to the next step
.Increment the divisor by 1
.Repeat from the 3rd step until the divisor is greater than the Number

Q2)
.Take as input a number that has to be between 1 and 12 inclusive
.If number is 1 output January
.If number is 2 output February
.If number is 3 output March
.If number is 4 output April
.If number is 5 output May
.If number is 6 output June
.If number is 7 output July
.If number is 8 output August
.If number is 9 output September
.If number is 10 output October
.If number is 11 output November
.If number is 12 output December

Q3)
.Take 2 numbers as input Num1 and Num2
.Take an operator as input from(+,-,*,/,%)
.If operator is + then Result = Num1 + Num2
.Else if operator is - then Result = Num1 - Num2
.Else if operator is * then Result = Num1 * Num2
.Else if operator is / then Result = Num1 / Num2
.Else if operator is % then Result = Num1 % Num2
.Output Result
